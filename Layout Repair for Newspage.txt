Layout Repair for Newspage
The code Newspage doesn't have any explicit layout issues. The code is well-structured and utilizes Flutter widgets effectively.

However, some potential improvements can be made to enhance the readability and maintainability of the code:

1. Add Comments
- Add more descriptive comments within the 'fetchPosts' method to explain the purpose of each step.
- Explain the 'getPostsData' variable and its role in mapping the received data.
- Comment the 'initState' method to clarify its initialization logic.

2. Formatting Consistency
- Apply consistent indentation throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand the code structure.
- Ensure that all curly braces are aligned properly for clarity.

3. Optimize 'fetchPosts' Method
- Replace the 'print' statements used for debugging with more appropriate error handling mechanisms like 'try...catch' or a custom logging system.
- Consider using 'dio' or 'http' package for more robust and efficient network calls.

4. Refactor 'Newspage' Code
- The 'fetchPosts' function within 'NewspageState' could be moved outside of the '_NewspageState' class to make it reusable.
- Define a separate data model class to hold the data received from the API, instead of using 'Getnews' directly.



Explanation of the Code:
- State Management: The Newspage uses a StatefulWidget to manage the state of the fetched posts.
- FutureBuilder: This widget is used to handle asynchronous data fetching and display loading indicators or error messages as needed.
- Model Class: The Getnews class is defined to represent the structure of the news data.
- Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling to manage API call failures.
